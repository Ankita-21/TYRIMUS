## Our inspiration behind TYRIMUS
* Many aspiring coders and software enthusiasts at some point in their journey make their first project, their first major software. More often than not, these softwares are not very efficient and are riddles with bugs. While this in itself is a huge step in a programmer's journey, we believe it can be made a far more fruitful and educative experience with the right guidance, i.e., via veteran programmers.
* Project TYRIMUS aims to connect all programmers, from coding novices to the best of the best. Some of our project's advantages are as follows: 
  - TYRIMUS aims to help coding newbies reach out to more experienced coders without having to make any extra efforts, once a project is completed, it is immediately published, readily available for all members of the website to read through and provide valuable feedback.
  - TYRIMUS aims to assist amateur and veteran coders in looking for partners or interns to provide assistance with large-scale projects. Furthermore, it helps them keep up with the quickly developing world of programming by going through our vast resources of code, programs and projects.
  - Our intensive and exhaustive resources ensure that none of our members ever feel at their wits' end.
